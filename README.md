# Starter Theme

Lightweight WordPress starter theme. Supports default formats and adds the ability to use custom post types and custom taxonomies.

## Start

For using custom post types and taxonomies uncomment includes `inc/post-types.php` and `inc/post-taxonomies.php` in `functions.php` and define options in these files.

## Styles and scripts

You can use any styles and scripts, preprocessors and builders. There are no dependencies by default.
